## Project Catwalk
This is the Hack Reactor Front End Capstone. The challenge was to create a modernized retail portal based on design specifications and requirements outlined by project stakeholders. As a group, we created a dynamic e-commerce browsing experience on an accelerated development timeline, with each team member builing out one of the four required components.

## Tech Stack and Challenges

### React
We utilized React on to implement a responsive, single-page application capable of rendering data from a third-party API. We implemented click tracking with higher order React components.


### Node.js and Express
<!-- - Despite being a front-end capstone that explicitly placed back-end implementation out of scope, used Nodejs to utilize Express. -->
<!-- - Simplified API requests by implementing a proxy server in Express.js that adds authentication while forwarding requests to an existing RESTful API. -->
Although the emphasis of this project was front-end development, we utilized an Express for Node.js server to route requests to a RESTful API with necessary authorization added. Express compression middleware was used for optimization.

### CSS
<!-- - Aside from being the sole technology used for the aesthetic styling of this application:
  - All styling, including functional implementations like the modals and image gallery, were written solely with CSS.
  - The use of Grid made the overlay button functionality and precise placement of static assets accessible and simple.
  - Flexbox was instrumental in handling the wealth of dynamic data being delivered to the page. -->
A goal of this project was to deeply understand CSS without importing addtional styling frameworks, so all styling and functional implementations were written purely with CSS. The app includes both a light mode and a dark mode, which were implemented using only CSS.

### Webpack
<!-- - Webpack was our solution to elegantly handle our numerous static assets, implement JSX, and harness ES6 in this project. -->
